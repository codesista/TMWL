			     	<strong>Meet Mike Halley</strong>.  <i>He's a retired US Marine who helps fellow soldiers find peace when they return home from war.</i>

			    <div id="cm_main">
			    	<p>I'm a Marine. My journey with the United States Marine Corps began in 1960. I served for eight years, including two tours in Vietnam.  I survived the horrors of that war, and returned home after the Tet Offensive to find a country that had abandoned us.</p>
			    	<p>After returning from Vietnam, I found myself at a loss. I couldn't get close to other people and I couldn't explain what was wrong with me. Just driving my truck down the road, I'd be in tears.  The explanation was found in the fact I have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an invisible disability that affects many Americans, military and civilians alike, following a traumatic event in their lives. My diagnosis finally came in 1988, twenty years after my honorable discharge from the Corps.</p>
			    	<p>It took my collection of experiences as a Marine to lead me to where I am today. Presently, my vocation is to serve my fellow service men and women find peace when they return home from war.  In 2007, I trained my Doberman pinscher, Porsche, to be my personal service dog.  Having a partner like Porsche has led to making my life better both in how I deal with my PTSD as well as how I relate with other people. </p>
			    	<p>Following the success of my training of Porsche, I was inundated with questions about who trained my dog or if I could train a dog for someone else with similar needs to mine.  This got me thinking and, as a result, I founded Halley's K-9s for Veterans in October of 2008. The goal of the organization is to provide service dogs to disabled veterans of all ages, to help these veterans overcome their invisible disabilities in order to become more productive and functional, and to inform the public of the need for service dogs other than seeing eye dogs.  Even with our humble beginnings, we've been very successful in teaming over 25 disabled veterans with their new partners, and we're very proud of the good we've been able to create as a result.</p>
			    	<p>Our next goal is to build a temporary home at our kennel where veterans can stay while we pair them with their service animals and, of course,  to expand our work to serve as many veterans as we possibly can. In my eyes, it's the least we can do for them.</p>
			    	<p>And I know it can make all the difference in the world.  It certainly has for me.</p>
